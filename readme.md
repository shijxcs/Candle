# Efficient and Long-Tailed Generalization for Pre-trained Vision-Language Model

This is the source code for the paper: [Efficient and Long-Tailed Generalization for Pre-trained Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12638) (KDD 2024).

## Install

This code is built on top of the codebase for [CoOp](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/CoOp). Please follow their instructions to prepare the required environments and datasets.

## Run

Please refer to the running scripts under `scripts/candle` for different experimental settings.  

Make sure to change the path of `DATA` in corresponding scripts and run the commands under the main directory.  

In `run_example.sh`, we provide some examples on how to run the model.
